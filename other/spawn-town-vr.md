# Spawn Town Values, Outline, and Regulations

## Spawn Town Values

1\. Spawn Town should:
* be free and easy to use
* provide equal opportunities for all players
* provide a service to the community
* be easily navigable
* provide a good first impression.

## Spawn Town Committee

### Outline
2\. The Spawn Town Committee is a group of staff members who have taken on the duty of maintaining and creating new Spawn Town standards.

3\. The Committee consists of all staff members, however is an optional duty and consists of mostly trusted members.

### Powers

4\. The Committee has the power to set and enforce the following in order to uphold the principles of Spawn Town:
* Restrictions on where players are allowed to build.
* Area-specific restrictions on the purpose of builds (e.g. shops only).
* Periods of inactivity beyond which a build may be removed.
* Build height restrictions.
* Restrictions on which items shops are allowed to sell.
* Restrictions on the price at which shops are allowed to sell items.

5\. The Committee can also make determinations outside of the rules listed in 6 with Admin consent

6\. In cases where existing builds conflict with a new Committee determination, the determination should give the players a reasonable amount of time to comply or grant them an exception.

7\. All new Committee regulations and interpretations require either:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) the unanimous consent of all active Committee members; or

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the consent of at least two committee members and no objections within 24 hours.

8\. Members of the Committee are allowed to repeal a regulation or decision with a 6 or more member backing, and no more than 4 opposing. This ratio can be adjusted based on activity.

9\. It is thought that when a new map comes to Froobworld, the Committee is to reevaluate its purpose and adjust/restructure as is needed.

## Spawn Town Regulations

1\. The first 2 rows are reserved for shops. Any non-shop builds must be made outside the first 2 rows. Non-shop builds within the first 2 rows will be removed by the spawn committee after a 2 weeks notice.

2\. Do not build outside your plot border. Any blocks outside borders will be removed without notice. Furthermore, do not change the plot border except for reasonable doorways.

3\. Shops must comply with lag restrictions. Shops that do not comply will be removed. Restrictions per plot are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 0 powered beacons

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 2 glow signs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 6 banners

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 15 item frames

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- No chests (barrels only)

4\. Stay within build height limits. Shops that go outside the set limits will be removed by the spawn committee after a 2 week notice. The first row of plots is allowed 25 blocks, and each subsequent row is allowed +10 more as distance from spawn increases. There are no limits to how low you can go!

5\. Inactive shops will be removed by the spawn committee. If a shop has been inactive for 2 weeks, the owner will get a 2 weeks notice via the in-game mail system. If there's no signs of activity after those 2 weeks, the shop will be removed.

6\. Shops must be built within 2 weeks of claiming the plot. If a shop is not built by that time, the claim will be removed and the plot will be reset for the next person.

7\. Prices cannot go under the set minimum prices. Shops that do go under these prices will be closed by the spawn committee until the owner fixes their prices. These prices can be found here: [Minimum-Prices](https://froobworld.com/wiki/Minimum_prices) 

8\. Only one shop per person/organization is allowed. This means you can't profit from or help with the upkeep of multiple shops. Organizations can't claim multiple plots as one for each member if they will actively help with the upkeep of the shops.

9\. Use common sense when interpreting these rules. Any loopholes will not be appreciated and will cause a reaction from the spawn committee.

10\. For every broken rule/removed shop, a player has 1 more chance, where they must rebuild one plot-row back. If rules are broken again, they will not be allowed to have a shop in Spawn Town.

11\. All shops must have a clear sign displaying who owns the shop.
