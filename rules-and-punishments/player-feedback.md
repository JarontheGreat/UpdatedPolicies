# Player Feedback

In order to promote transparency between staff and players, it is encouraged that players use our [Player Contact Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwLHIxw4l0wYWD70ZZ2zC_o56QElSNO-dqsfbhCyTcgupvEw/viewform) to submit suggestions, concerns and criticism. 

When carrying out review of your suggestions, concerns and criticisms, the following will happen:

+ Your message will be sent directly to the admin team, where it will be reviewed quickly.

+ After review, we will evalute your message and make corrections as needed to our structure and system.

+ Once changes are made, you will recieve a response via email (which you provide on the form).

Thank you to those who use the feedback system, each message is greatly appreciated.
