# Staff Polices

This is a collection of policies to be followed by staff members (Admins, Staff, and Trusted) on Froobworld. This is a clarification of Froobworld's Rules and Punishments to specify staff actions.

## Demotion

The demotion of a staff member, as stated in all appointment policies, is to happen because of one of the following:

+ Inactivity
   - Admins: An extended period of time with no indication of returning
   - Staff and Trusted: a 6-month period

+ A clear violation of Froobworld Policies
   - As the upholders of rules on Froobworld, staff members should follow all rules strictly. Violations should be reported to higher staff members or equals.

## Internal Relations

It is thought that, while somewhat separate in duties, the Froobworld staff team is to work together cohesively to keep our community functional. In this way, everyone is considered an equal, with all opinions being valued the same.

The following will not be tolerated between members of staff or between staff and players:

+ Pressuring others to make decisions
    - Every staff member has their own voice, and this should never be undermined or altered by those in positions viewed to be higher.

+ Pestering other members about past mistakes
    - Mistakes are common and a part of learning. In now way should a staff member repremand another staff member for clearly unintentional mistakes.

+ Dismissing other's opinions
    - Every staff member contributes equally to the conversation, belittling this value should never occur.

+ Responding to other's success with resentment
    - Every staff member contributes equally to Froobworld, and each one is celebrated as a volunteer working towards making their community a better place. In moments of other's success, it is not okay for negativity to be spread in response.

## External Relations

It is thought that the Froobworld staff team is to be an extension of the players, made up by players. As a result, transparency should be used as much as possible to inform players about decisions that are affecting the community they have dedicated time to.

For this reason, the following are to take place as stated:
